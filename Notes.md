# To Do:
## Minor Fixes:
- ~~Make sure when songs are playing, it is showing the visualiser, house style songs do not work properly, sometimes cutting out when there is silence.~~ Changed to max value = 20, still to improve song playing detection...
- The stretching of window ruins the resolution of the image, mildly intentional, pixelated backgrounds run faster...
- Font selector maybe
## Big changes
- WindowsRT in WIP will allow any media titles and names to be recognised, allow both spotify and windows modes
- MacOS and Linux support somehow (WASAPI is the best loopback)
- Performance needs improvement. Threading spotify data collection and graphics could help.
- ...

~~This maybe the last time i commit (sad) it works well enough, good luck !~~ I just love this project too much i will keep going...
